## Assignment Operator
Without running the following code, try to determine:

```js
let a = 1;
let b = 'bongos';
let c = true;

a = b;
b = c;
c = a;
```

### Your solution here:
1.  What is `a`?
```
a is ...
```
2.  What is `b`?
```
b is ...
```
3.  What is `c`?
```
c is ...
```

## Concatenation
Use the `+` operator to concatenate these strings together within a `console.log()`: "Please", "squeeze", "the", "cheese". Make sure there are spaces in-between each word.

```js
const firstWord = "Please";
const secondWord = "squeeze";
const thirdWord = "the";
const fourthWord = "cheese";
```
Result should be:
```js
"Please squeeze the cheese"
```

### Your solution here:
4.  Fill in the `console.log()`?
```js
console.log()
```


## Comparisons
By just looking at the following expressions, determine in your mind whether or not each will evaluate to true or false
```
a) 999 > 999
b) 999 === 999 
c) 999 !== 999
d) -5 >= -4
e) 100 <= -100
f) 20 + 5 < 5 
g) 81 / 9 === 9
h) 9 !== 8 + 1
```
### Your solution here:
7.  Write `true` or `false` based on the list above
```
a) 
b)  
c)
d) 
e) 
f) 
g) 
h) 
```

## Conditionals
Declare a variable equal to a number 0 to 100

Write a conditional statement that...
- If it is a multiple of 3, print “Fizz” instead of the number.
- If it is a multiple of 5, print “Buzz” instead of the number.
- If it is a multiple of both 3 and 5, print “FizzBuzz” instead of the number.
- Otherwise, print the number

### Your solution here:
8.  Write your javascript solution below
```js
// your answer here
```

## Functions

### currencyConverter(currency, amount)

Define a function `currencyConverter` that takes two arguments an amount and a currency (USD, GBP, EGP, BD) and returns the converted version of the amount in Riyals. Use the if-then-else construct available in Javascript.

**Hint :**
> - 1 Riyal = 4.68 Egyptian pound 
> - 1 Riyal = 0.10 Bahraini dinar

### isCharacterAVowel(character)

Write a function `isCharacterAVowel` that takes a character (i.e. a string of length 1) and returns true if it is a vowel and false, otherwise.
